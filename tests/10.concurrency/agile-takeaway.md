### Make it fast

One formulation of an agile way of building software, often misattributed to Kent Beck, is:
`Make it work, make it right, make it fast.`
Where 'work' is making the tests pass, 'right' is refactoring the code, and 'fast' is optimizing the code to make it, for example, run quickly. We can only 'make it fast' once we've made it work and made it right. We were lucky that the code we were given was already demonstrated to be working, and didn't need to be refactored. We should never try to 'make it fast' before the other two steps have been performed because:
