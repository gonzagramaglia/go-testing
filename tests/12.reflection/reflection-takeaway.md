### Wrapping up

* Introduced some concepts from the `reflect` package.
* Used recursion to traverse arbitrary data structures.
* Did an in retrospect bad refactor but didn't get too upset about it. By working iteratively with tests it's not such a big deal.
* This only covered a small aspect of reflection. [The Go blog has an excellent post covering more details](https://go.dev/blog/laws-of-reflection).
* Now that you know about reflection, **do your best to avoid using it**.
